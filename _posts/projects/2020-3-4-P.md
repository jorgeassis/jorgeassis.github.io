This project adopts an interdisciplinary approach, employing comprehensive measures of biodiversity that encompass variation both within and between species and ecosystems. It also considers various environmental variables, carbon cycle dynamics, and climate change scenarios. Our team consists of experts in marine biology, taxonomy, ecology, oceanography, biogeochemistry, biogeography, MPA network design, benthic habitat mapping, carbon dynamics, as well as species distribution and climate modeling.

The project is ambitious in committing to achieve several firsts in terms of products based on new data and analyses.
