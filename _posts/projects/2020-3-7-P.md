This project aims to bring together various disciplines to investigate the impact of climate change on aquaculture. We will employ climate and species distribution models, as well as genome sequencing and SNP profiling, to advance our understanding of aquaculture suitability and population dynamics in the face of changing environmental conditions.

Our first objective involves the development of climate analog models based on relevant abiotic parameters in aquaculture. These models will allow us to predict changes in aquaculture suitability on an EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) scale.

Subsequently, we will leverage our expertise in genetics to delve into the genetic population structure of Saccharina latissima, a seaweed of increasing interest in European aquaculture. This study will span climate gradients and will compare farmed and wild populations of this seaweed species.

Furthermore, we aim to explore strategies for integrating information from various sources, including modeling and genetics, to promote sustainable aquaculture development. This effort is critical for addressing the challenges posed by climate change in the aquaculture industry.
