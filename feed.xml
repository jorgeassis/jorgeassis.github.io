<p>Cold-water corals (CWCs) are critical ecosystem-structuring species that provide essential services, from continental shelves to abyssal depths. They create complex, three-dimensional habitats, acting as feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a wide range of commercially important fish and invertebrates. Their future, however, is heavily dependent on the planet’s climate trajectory.</p>

<h5>The critical knowledge gap</h5>

<p>Despite their immense ecological importance, knowledge of the global distribution, diversity patterns, and overall vulnerability of cold-water corals to climate change remains severely limited. This knowledge gap constrains effective, large-scale conservation strategies, particularly the design of robust Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) needed to meet global protection targets.</p>

<h5>Our main approach</h5>

<p>We conducted the most extensive global assessment of CWC biogeography to date, analyzing 741 species spanning six major taxonomic groups. We used this data to predict species distributions under present-day conditions and project future shifts under two contrasting end-of-century climate scenarios: the low-emission SSP1-1.9 (aligned with the Paris Agreement) and the high-emission SSP3-7.0. Our analysis was based on three pillars:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mapping global species richness and identifying biodiversity hotspots.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Delineating ten distinct cold-water coral bioregions based on species co-occurrence.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Quantifying projected shifts in species richness, community turnover, and identifying climate refugia.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge: how we tackle the study</h5>

<p>To accurately model the distribution of these complex, low-dispersal organisms, we employed an ensemble of high-performance machine learning Species Distribution Models (SDMs), including Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Our key methodological innovations included:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Monotonicity constraints: We applied ecological constraints to the models (e.g., assuming higher maximum temperature has a negative effect), ensuring the predictions were biologically realistic and reducing the risk of overfitting.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Dispersal constraints: To account for the slow growth rates and limited dispersal of CWCs, we clipped distribution maps using a maximum dispersal constraint of 200km, which significantly reduced overprediction.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Bioregion validation: We used k-means clustering to delineate the ten bioregions and statistically confirmed their distinctiveness using Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM).</p>

<h5>The main finding</h5>

<p>Our results showed major biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and delineated ten distinct bioregions, each with varying species richness, depth distribution patterns, and generally low levels of endemicity.</p>

<p>Fig. Present-day species richness distribution for 741 species of cold-water corals.</p>

<p>While the global extent of suitable CWC habitat is projected to persist, species-level redistributions will drive dramatic change, with the magnitude strongly tied to emission levels. We identified the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea as major present-day biodiversity hotspots. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP3-7.0), we projected:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Widespread poleward and depth shifts, with average species distribution projected to deepen by 26.0m.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Significant biodiversity loss in shallow and low-latitude regions, with the Central Western Atlantic projected to lose up to 66 species.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Richness gains primarily concentrated in deeper offshore areas and the Arctic, indicating potential but fragile new habitats.</p>

Turnover ranges from 0 (no change in species composition) to 1 (complete replacement). Areas with no species present are shown in white.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>

<p>Our findings underscore the urgent need for global climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement. The study provides an actionable framework to support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.</p>

<h5>Knowledge gap</h5>
<p>Global marine conservation efforts are severely hampered by a pervasive lack of current, consistent data and chronic underfunding. Monitoring biodiversity in remote, complex ecosystems like coral reefs is traditionally expensive, requiring specialized equipment and expert taxonomic knowledge. This results in:
<br /><br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Massive Data Deficiencies: Less than 6% of described species have been assessed for extinction risk by the IUCN, and up to 17,000 of those are “data deficient.” This gap is most pronounced in marine ecosystems.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Slow Data Processing: Citizen Science programs, like the invaluable Reef Life Survey (RLS), are generating high-quality image data much faster than expert taxonomists can label them. This creates a bottleneck that limits the real-world impact of citizen efforts.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>We hypothesized that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)—the cutting-edge AI architecture that can process both image and text data—could effectively leverage vast Citizen Science datasets to automate the laborious task of benthic image classification. Our approach specifically focused on:
<br /><br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Leveraging Citizen Science Data: Using tens of thousands of seabed images and their multi-label annotations from the Reef Life Survey (RLS) project.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Multimodal AI: Utilizing the Qwen-2.5-VL MLLM family, which are capable of interpreting images of the seafloor and the associated labels simultaneously.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Advanced Fine-Tuning: Applying efficient fine-tuning techniques (QLoRA) to specialize a pre-trained, general-purpose MLLM for the complex, domain-specific task of classifying benthic organisms and substrate.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The research was a rigorous exploration of optimizing MLLMs for this specific task. We addressed two main technological challenges:
<br /><br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Optimizing Untrained Model Performance (Prompt Engineering): before fine-tuning, we tested various prompt engineering techniques—the art of giving the AI better instructions—to get the best possible results from the general-purpose model.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Achieving Domain Expertise (Fine-Tuning): we employed QLoRA to efficiently adapt the MLLMs to the RLS dataset. Our experiments compared different model sizes (3B vs. 7B parameters) and the effect of adding contextual data (like geographic co-ordinates) during training.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>The top-performing model—the 7B parameter MLLM fine-tuned on the largest dataset—achieved an average F1-score of 0.45. This score is directly comparable to previous high-performing, task-specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that have been integrated into professional marine monitoring workflows, such as those used by NOAA. Key Takeaways from the Final Model:
<br /><br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> High-Frequency Labels: The model excelled at identifying common, well-represented classes like Ecklonia radiata (a type of kelp), achieving an F1-score of 0.706.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Imbalanced Data Challenge: The model struggled with rare species (low-frequency classes), which is a common limitation when dealing with real-world, highly imbalanced biodiversity datasets.</p>

<h5>Main implications</h5>
<p>This research validates Multimodal Large Language Models as a robust, scalable, and powerful alternative to traditional Computer Vision models (like CNNs) for ecological classification. The combined approach of Citizen Science and MLLMs offers a clear path to:
<br /><br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Unlock the RLS Data Archive: Significantly accelerate the labeling of the vast, high-quality RLS photo archives, turning raw data into actionable biodiversity insights faster than ever before.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Scale Global Monitoring: Create a foundation for global, cost-effective monitoring programs that can leverage publicly submitted imagery for real-time assessment of coral reef health.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Advance AI in Ecology: Establish MLLMs and transformer architecture as a strong contender in the field of marine and terrestrial ecology, which is currently dominated by CNNs.</p>

<p>With further research into increasing training data, scaling to even larger models (32B/72B), and optimizing for low-frequency species, the potential for MLLMs to exceed current benthic classification models is considerable, fundamentally enhancing our ability to protect the world’s oceans.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="featured" /><category term="artificial intelligence" /><category term="biodiversity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prospects of using multimodal Artificial Intelligence with Citizen Science to monitor Coral reefs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Global estimates of ocean current connectivity</title><link href="/global-estimates-ocean-current-connectivity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Global estimates of ocean current connectivity" /><published>2025-06-25T03:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-25T03:30:00+01:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/global-estimates-ocean-current-connectivity/"><![CDATA[<p>How do marine species travel the world? Ocean currents act as “highways” for marine life, moving larvae, individuals, and genetic material between populations.</p>

<p>But understanding these connections on a global scale, and how they shape biodiversity, has been almost impossible. We generated the first-ever global estimates of ocean current connectivity, tracking 204 million particles over 21 years. This new dataset is a benchmark for marine conservation and climate change resilience.</p>

<h5>Knowledge gap</h5>
<p>Despite its importance, a comprehensive, high-resolution global dataset of oceanographic connectivity has been missing. Traditional studies often rely on overly simple models that fail to capture the complex, variable, and asymmetric dispersal patterns created by real-world ocean currents. This knowledge gap has hindered our ability to understand species’ dispersal and develop effective large-scale conservation strategies, especially for building resilience to climate change.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>We tackled this gap by creating the first comprehensive dataset of connectivity estimates (both probability and travel time) along all the world’s coastlines. We used a robust biophysical model that simulates passive dispersal, essentially tracking “virtual larvae” carried by ocean currents.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The scale of this challenge was immense. Our model used 21 years of daily, high-resolution global ocean current data (GLORYS12V1). We released particles daily from 26,642 coastal sites worldwide, running Lagrangian simulations to track over 204 million individual particle trajectories. To make this massive dataset (which includes 195 million recorded connectivity events) accessible and useful, we also developed <b>coastalNet</b>, an R package designed to streamline the access, analysis, and visualization of the connectivity data.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>The result is a new, publicly available benchmark dataset for oceanographic connectivity research. It provides pairwise probabilities and travel times between coastal locations, which can be flexibly combined with species-specific biological traits. Researchers can now filter the data by planktonic duration (from hours up to 180 days) and by seasonality (spawning periods) to create realistic dispersal models for thousands of different marine species.</p>

<h5>Main implications</h5>
<p>This dataset is a powerful new tool for marine conservation and management. It provides the critical data needed to:

<p>Despite clear evidence that shipping activity—through vessel collisions, noise pollution, and disturbance—severely impacts marine megafauna like cetaceans, sea turtles, pinnipeds, and seabirds, there was no comprehensive global map to guide conservation efforts. We lacked the vital knowledge to distinguish between undisturbed biodiversity refuges and high-risk conflict zones at a planetary scale.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>We conducted a global assessment by overlaying two critical layers: a composite measure of species richness for the four vulnerable faunal groups and vessel density derived from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. By classifying both metrics into terciles (low, medium, high), we were able to define two new conservation categories:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Priority Preservation Areas (PPAs): Regions of high species richness overlapping with low or minimal shipping activity (biodiversity refuges).<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Priority Mitigation Areas (PMAs): Regions of high species richness overlapping with high shipping density (high-risk conflict zones)</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The core challenge was translating vast, continuous streams of global maritime traffic (AIS data) and highly dynamic species distribution models (AquaMaps and BirdLife) into a single, actionable risk assessment framework. We used a bivariate mapping approach in R to synthesize these complex datasets, enabling us to quantify the interplay between biodiversity value and potential impact risk across every marine grid cell, making the findings globally consistent and scalable.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>Our maps reveal that biodiversity is concentrated in two major zones. PPAs—our ocean’s last large, undisturbed refuges—are predominantly found in the remote, high southern latitudes, near Antarctica. Conversely, PMAs are clustered along coastlines and in critical trans-oceanic passages, especially in the mid-Pacific, southern Indian Ocean, and South Atlantic.</p>

<p>Fig. Distribution of shipless areas (blue), representing regions with minimal or negligible vessel activity. Marine Protected Areas (&gt;100,000 ha) are overlaid in green, while Exclusive Economic Zone boundaries are marked with dotted lines.</p>

<p>Crucially, we found that existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are currently falling short: they cover only 15.2% of PPAs and 16.2% of PMAs, leaving vast priority areas unprotected or unmanaged.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>
<p>These findings provide a clear roadmap for achieving global marine conservation goals, including the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the $30 \times 30$ target. We need a dual-strategy approach to marine spatial planning:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Preserve: Immediately designate the identified PPAs as new MPAs or equivalent conservation measures to safeguard these essential, shipless biodiversity refuges before future traffic routes encroach.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mitigate: Implement targeted shipping management strategies in PMAs, such as mandatory vessel speed reductions to minimize lethal collisions and noise pollution, and dynamic traffic rerouting to avoid seasonal biodiversity hotspots.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Govern: Use this framework to inform international policies on the High Seas, helping countries and organizations balance vital maritime trade with the urgent need to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="featured" /><category term="conservation" /><category term="biodiversity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global maritime industry, the lifeblood of our modern economy, is rapidly expanding, but its growing footprint poses an immense, quantified threat to the ocean's largest inhabitants.]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-211/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-04-01T03:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T03:30:00+01:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-211/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-3/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-5/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-5/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-211/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-211/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-2/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Projected climate change threatens European Seahorses</title><link href="/climate-change-threaten-european-seahorses-conservation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Projected climate change threatens European Seahorses" /><published>2025-02-25T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/climate-change-threaten-european-seahorses-conservation/"><![CDATA[<h5>The knowledge gap</h5>

<p>Climate change models often predict a simple poleward shift for marine life, assuming species can freely reach new suitable areas. For species with naturally low mobility, such as seahorses, this assumption is deeply flawed. We needed to understand how oceanographic connectivity—the ability of ocean currents to carry juveniles or rafting adults—interacts with climate-driven habitat shifts across their range.</p>

<h5>The main approach</h5>

<p>To address this, we integrated two powerful computational frameworks. First, we used Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (ESDM) under high- and low-emission scenarios (SSP5 and SSP2) to map where suitable seahorse habitat will be in 2100. Second, we coupled this with a state-of-the-art biophysical model to simulate two realistic dispersal pathways: short pelagic drifting (14 days) and longer passive rafting (100 days).</p>

<h5>Technological challenge: how we tackle the study</h5>

<p>The core challenge was linking predictive habitat maps with real-world ocean current simulations. We utilized coastalNet, a biophysical model, to calculate multi-generational dispersal estimates. This graph-theoretical approach allowed us to see which newly-suitable northern areas could actually be reached by seahorses originating from current populations, effectively turning an ‘unlimited movement’ prediction into a ‘connectivity-constrained’ reality.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"></div>

<h5>The main finding</h5>

<p>The incorporation of dispersal ability radically changed the forecast, revealing greater conservation risk than previously estimated:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Hippocampus guttulatus is projected to experience severe habitat contraction (up to 45% loss under high-emission scenarios), rather than the predicted expansion seen in standard models.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Hippocampus hippocampus still shows limited range expansion (+8% to +12%), but this is significantly less than the 17% expansion predicted by models that ignore dispersal limits.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Both species face severe losses across the southern distribution, particularly in the Mediterranean and North Africa, where the worst-case scenario (SSP5) projected over 80% and 50% loss for H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus, respectively.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>

<p>This research provides essential, grounded data for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 14 (Life Below Water). The findings necessitate an immediate shift in conservation strategy:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Prioritize climate refugia: We must strengthen protection measures in areas projected to remain stable, such as the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, and parts of the northern Iberian Atlantic Coast, especially under the lower-emission SSP2 scenario.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mitigate local stressors: For isolated, vulnerable populations (e.g., in the Mediterranean’s Thau Lagoon), addressing localized threats like pollution, dredging, and destructive fishing is paramount, as they cannot relocate to escape climate change.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Spatial planning: Conservation efforts must now integrate oceanographic connectivity to identify and safeguard corridors necessary for future range shifts, ensuring that new suitable habitats are reachable.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="featured" /><category term="climate change" /><category term="conservation" /><category term="biodiversity" /><category term="paris agreement" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data science models show limited dispersal severely restricts seahorse adaptation to climate change, leading to major habitat contraction.]]></summary></entry></feed>
