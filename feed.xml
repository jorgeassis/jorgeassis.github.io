Our research focuses on the significant role that oceanographic connectivity—driven by water transport and dispersal—plays in shaping this diversity on a global scale.</p>

<p>Key findings: It’s all about connections</p>

<p>What did we find? It turns out that ocean currents play a much bigger role than previously thought in shaping the genetic makeup of marine forests across the globe. Imagine these currents as underwater highways, carrying tiny reproductive cells (like seeds) from one seaweed population to another.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eco-Evolutionary Puzzle: We combined genetic data from nearly 700 seaweed populations with cutting-edge models of ocean currents. This allowed us to piece together the complex puzzle of how site-specific factors, ocean connectivity, and even rare long-distance dispersal events interact to shape genetic diversity.</li>
  <li>The 18.7% Surprise: Our research shows that almost one-fifth (18.7%) of the variation in genetic diversity across marine forests can be directly linked to the patterns of ocean circulation. This is a significant finding!</li>
  <li>Global Implications: This isn’t just about seaweed. Understanding how connected different populations are has major implications for marine conservation. It means we can better identify which areas to protect, ensuring that these vital ecosystems remain healthy and resilient in the face of climate change and other threats.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why this matters?</p>

<p>Marine forests are like the underwater equivalent of rainforests – teeming with life and providing essential habitats for countless species. They also play a key role in capturing carbon and supporting fisheries. By understanding the forces that shape their genetic diversity, we’re taking a big step towards safeguarding these precious ecosystems for future generations.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Data" /><category term="Biodiversity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genetic diversity of marine forests arises from complex eco-evolutionary interactions.

Errors in species identification, location data, and inconsistent formatting across different sources often hinder reliable research.</p>

<p>Our team has addressed these challenges by developing a comprehensive, quality-controlled dataset focused specifically on Demospongiae occurrence records. We have aggregated data from multiple sources, carefully checked for errors, and cross-referenced records with expert knowledge on the expected geographic and depth ranges of each species. The dataset is formatted in the Darwin Core Standard, making it easy to use with a wide range of research tools.</p>

<p>This dataset offers marine scientists a powerful resource for investigating demosponge diversity patterns, including hotspots of species richness and unique species (endemism). It can also help predict how sponge populations might shift in response to climate change, guiding more effective conservation measures. We are committed to the principle of making research data openly accessible. By providing this dataset, we hope to advance marine science and our understanding of Earth’s precious oceans.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Data" /><category term="Biodiversity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Demosponges, a dominant group within the sponge phylum, play crucial roles in the health of our oceans.

Understanding how this shifting climate will alter kelp biodiversity and ecosystem health is essential, yet the full scope of potential changes remains unclear. This uncertainty hinders effective conservation and management, leaving these vital marine ecosystems vulnerable.</p>

<p>Our research team is addressing this knowledge gap. We’ve harnessed machine-learning models to project how climate change might affect the distribution and biodiversity of 105 different kelp species worldwide. Our models consider different climate scenarios, including a future where the Paris Agreement targets are met, and one with higher emissions. Our findings suggest that kelp species are likely to move towards the poles and into deeper waters as temperatures rise. The total area of suitable kelp habitat may decline by around 15%, with dramatic shifts in kelp communities occurring in the Arctic, Northern Pacific, Atlantic, and Australasia.  If emissions remain high, some regions may experience severe biodiversity loss with important kelp species disappearing completely, impacting the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>This research offers a stark warning about the future of kelp forests, but it also provides a vital tool. Policymakers and conservationists can use our data to identify the areas where kelp biodiversity is most vulnerable, prioritize efforts to protect and possibly restore the most critical kelp habitats, and understand how marine ecosystems might change so conservation strategies can be adapted accordingly.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="" /><category term="" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Climate change threatens to disrupt these underwater havens, but we can take action.

<p>Our team addresses these issues by providing detailed range maps for 980 marine species critical to ocean health, including seagrasses, kelps, fucoids, and cold-water corals. These maps cover both current distributions (2010-2020) and future scenarios (2090-2100).  Importantly, our projections use the latest climate models, from low emission scenarios outlined in the Paris Agreement to higher emission possibilities, giving a realistic range of potential outcomes.</p>

<p>Building these maps involved advanced machine learning algorithms, the most comprehensive datasets available, and careful quality control.  This focus on accuracy means our maps offer a powerful tool for policymakers and conservationists, offering insights into:</p>

Until now, the impacts and projections of these events have focused on the sea surface, however, localized observations suggest that marine heatwaves can occur below the surface and persist for years. The rising of ocean temperatures has profound consequences for the planet’s geochemical and biological systems, directly affecting marine flora and fauna, and therefore the resources humans depend on.</p>

<p>Using global-level sea temperature observations and reanalysis data, our reseearch group estimated the duration and intensity of marine heatwaves from 1993 to 2019 at depths down to 2,000 meters. The research published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows that the highest intensity of marine heatwaves is not at the surface but in the subsurface, specifically between 50 and 250 meters deep. “Against our initial expectations, we found that marine heat waves are more intense below the surface, and their duration can last up to double, when compared to the surface,” notes Eliza Fragkopoulou, the leading author of the study.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/figure2-b.webp" alt="Heatwaves are intense and persist in deeper waters" style="max-height: 625px;" /></p>

<p>We combined these findings with data on marine species ranges, and predicted that subsurface biodiversity could be at risk due to higher cumulative intensity (an indicator of thermal stress) in the first 250 meters. Jorge Assis, who led the research explains: “Across the globe, we identified regions of higher risk for marine biodiversity, including significant portions of the Indian and North Atlantic Oceans, where high cumulative heatwave intensity coincides with areas of predicted high species sensitivity to thermal stress. What we’ve discovered is that beyond readily detectable surface effects, such as losses of ecosystem structuring species of mangrove and kelp forests and coral reefs, marine heatwaves can have profound effects on deeper biodiversity, down to 250 meters.”</p>

<p>A noteworthy aspect of this study is the extension of temperature changes from the surface to greatest depths. However, temperature data from deep areas should be taken with caution, especially data prior to 2004, when a more reliable measurement system was implemented. In addition to temperature increases, other changes in ocean conditions need consideration. Temperature extremes are expected to redistribute marine species from the surface to the deep ocean, however, additional constrains, such as low oxygen regions, may hinder such redistribution, with unpredictable consequences. In this context, additional monitoring of marine biodiversity under ongoing extreme climate conditions is needed to better understand and predict their effects.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="" /><category term="" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global analysis shows deep marine biodiversity facing higher risk of exposure to the cumulative effect of intense and prolonged heatwave events.]]></summary></entry></feed>
