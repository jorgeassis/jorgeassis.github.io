<p>Cold-water corals (CWCs) are critical ecosystem-structuring species that provide essential services, from continental shelves to abyssal depths. They create complex, three-dimensional habitats, acting as feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a wide range of commercially important fish and invertebrates. Their future, however, is heavily dependent on the planet’s climate trajectory.</p>

<h5>The critical knowledge gap</h5>

<p>Despite their immense ecological importance, knowledge of the global distribution, diversity patterns, and overall vulnerability of cold-water corals to climate change remains severely limited. This knowledge gap constrains effective, large-scale conservation strategies, particularly the design of robust Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) needed to meet global protection targets.</p>

<h5>Our main approach</h5>

<p>We conducted the most extensive global assessment of CWC biogeography to date, analyzing 741 species spanning six major taxonomic groups. We used this data to predict species distributions under present-day conditions and project future shifts under two contrasting end-of-century climate scenarios: the low-emission SSP1-1.9 (aligned with the Paris Agreement) and the high-emission SSP3-7.0. Our analysis was based on three pillars:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mapping global species richness and identifying biodiversity hotspots.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Delineating ten distinct cold-water coral bioregions based on species co-occurrence.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Quantifying projected shifts in species richness, community turnover, and identifying climate refugia.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge: how we tackle the study</h5>

<p>To accurately model the distribution of these complex, low-dispersal organisms, we employed an ensemble of high-performance machine learning Species Distribution Models (SDMs), including Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Our key methodological innovations included:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Monotonicity constraints: We applied ecological constraints to the models (e.g., assuming higher maximum temperature has a negative effect), ensuring the predictions were biologically realistic and reducing the risk of overfitting.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Dispersal constraints: To account for the slow growth rates and limited dispersal of CWCs, we clipped distribution maps using a maximum dispersal constraint of 200km, which significantly reduced overprediction.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Bioregion validation: We used k-means clustering to delineate the ten bioregions and statistically confirmed their distinctiveness using Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM).</p>

<h5>The main finding</h5>

<p>Our results showed major biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and delineated ten distinct bioregions, each with varying species richness, depth distribution patterns, and generally low levels of endemicity.</p>

<p>Fig. Present-day species richness distribution for 741 species of cold-water corals.</p>

<p>While the global extent of suitable CWC habitat is projected to persist, species-level redistributions will drive dramatic change, with the magnitude strongly tied to emission levels. We identified the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea as major present-day biodiversity hotspots. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP3-7.0), we projected:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Widespread poleward and depth shifts, with average species distribution projected to deepen by 26.0m.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Significant biodiversity loss in shallow and low-latitude regions, with the Central Western Atlantic projected to lose up to 66 species.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Richness gains primarily concentrated in deeper offshore areas and the Arctic, indicating potential but fragile new habitats.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>

<p>Our findings underscore the urgent need for global climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement. The study provides an actionable framework to support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.</p>

Ocean currents act as “highways” for marine life, moving larvae, individuals, and genetic material between populations.</p>

<p>But understanding these connections on a global scale, and how they shape biodiversity, has been almost impossible. We generated the first-ever global estimates of ocean current connectivity, tracking 204 million particles over 21 years. This new dataset is a benchmark for marine conservation and climate change resilience.</p>

<h5>Knowledge gap</h5>
<p>Despite its importance, a comprehensive, high-resolution global dataset of oceanographic connectivity has been missing. Traditional studies often rely on overly simple models that fail to capture the complex, variable, and asymmetric dispersal patterns created by real-world ocean currents. This knowledge gap has hindered our ability to understand species’ dispersal and develop effective large-scale conservation strategies, especially for building resilience to climate change.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>We tackled this gap by creating the first comprehensive dataset of connectivity estimates (both probability and travel time) along all the world’s coastlines. We used a robust biophysical model that simulates passive dispersal, essentially tracking “virtual larvae” carried by ocean currents.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The scale of this challenge was immense. Our model used 21 years of daily, high-resolution global ocean current data (GLORYS12V1). We released particles daily from 26,642 coastal sites worldwide, running Lagrangian simulations to track over 204 million individual particle trajectories. To make this massive dataset (which includes 195 million recorded connectivity events) accessible and useful, we also developed <b>coastalNet</b>, an R package designed to streamline the access, analysis, and visualization of the connectivity data.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>The result is a new, publicly available benchmark dataset for oceanographic connectivity research. It provides pairwise probabilities and travel times between coastal locations, which can be flexibly combined with species-specific biological traits. Researchers can now filter the data by planktonic duration (from hours up to 180 days) and by seasonality (spawning periods) to create realistic dispersal models for thousands of different marine species.</p>

<h5>Main implications</h5>
<p>This dataset is a powerful new tool for marine conservation and management. It provides the critical data needed to:
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Inform more effective conservation strategies, such as designing and assessing networks of Marine Protected Areas.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Understand and predict species’ resilience and potential for range expansion under climate change.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Enable a deeper exploration of the complex dynamics that shape coastal marine ecosystems.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Calculate multi-generational “stepping-stone” connectivity, identifying crucial pathways for dispersal over long distances.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="data" /><category term="archived" /><category term="connectivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global estimates of ocean current connectivity, a benchmark for marine conservation and climate change resilience]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mapping global shipless areas and conflicts with biodiversity</title><link href="/global-shipless-areas-conflict-with-biodiversity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mapping global shipless areas and conflicts with biodiversity" /><published>2025-04-25T03:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-25T03:30:00+01:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/global-shipless-areas-conflict-with-biodiversity/"><![CDATA[<h5>The knowledge gap</h5>
<p>Despite clear evidence that shipping activity—through vessel collisions, noise pollution, and disturbance—severely impacts marine megafauna like cetaceans, sea turtles, pinnipeds, and seabirds, there was no comprehensive global map to guide conservation efforts. We lacked the vital knowledge to distinguish between undisturbed biodiversity refuges and high-risk conflict zones at a planetary scale.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>We conducted a global assessment by overlaying two critical layers: a composite measure of species richness for the four vulnerable faunal groups and vessel density derived from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. By classifying both metrics into terciles (low, medium, high), we were able to define two new conservation categories:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Priority Preservation Areas (PPAs): Regions of high species richness overlapping with low or minimal shipping activity (biodiversity refuges).<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Priority Mitigation Areas (PMAs): Regions of high species richness overlapping with high shipping density (high-risk conflict zones)</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The core challenge was translating vast, continuous streams of global maritime traffic (AIS data) and highly dynamic species distribution models (AquaMaps and BirdLife) into a single, actionable risk assessment framework. We used a bivariate mapping approach in R to synthesize these complex datasets, enabling us to quantify the interplay between biodiversity value and potential impact risk across every marine grid cell, making the findings globally consistent and scalable.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>Our maps reveal that biodiversity is concentrated in two major zones. PPAs—our ocean’s last large, undisturbed refuges—are predominantly found in the remote, high southern latitudes, near Antarctica. Conversely, PMAs are clustered along coastlines and in critical trans-oceanic passages, especially in the mid-Pacific, southern Indian Ocean, and South Atlantic.</p>

<p>Fig. Distribution of shipless areas (blue), representing regions with minimal or negligible vessel activity. Marine Protected Areas (&gt;100,000 ha) are overlaid in green, while Exclusive Economic Zone boundaries are marked with dotted lines.</p>

<p>Crucially, we found that existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are currently falling short: they cover only 15.2% of PPAs and 16.2% of PMAs, leaving vast priority areas unprotected or unmanaged.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>
<p>These findings provide a clear roadmap for achieving global marine conservation goals, including the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the $30 \times 30$ target. We need a dual-strategy approach to marine spatial planning:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Preserve: Immediately designate the identified PPAs as new MPAs or equivalent conservation measures to safeguard these essential, shipless biodiversity refuges before future traffic routes encroach.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mitigate: Implement targeted shipping management strategies in PMAs, such as mandatory vessel speed reductions to minimize lethal collisions and noise pollution, and dynamic traffic rerouting to avoid seasonal biodiversity hotspots.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Govern: Use this framework to inform international policies on the High Seas, helping countries and organizations balance vital maritime trade with the urgent need to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="featured" /><category term="conservation" /><category term="biodiversity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global maritime industry, the lifeblood of our modern economy, is rapidly expanding, but its growing footprint poses an immense, quantified threat to the ocean's largest inhabitants.]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-211/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-04-01T03:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T03:30:00+01:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-211/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-5/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-5/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-10T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-3/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-211/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-211/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html"></title><link href="/marine-forever-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="" /><published>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-01T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marine-forever-2/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="archived" /><category term="" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Projected climate change threatens European Seahorses</title><link href="/climate-change-threaten-european-seahorses-conservation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Projected climate change threatens European Seahorses" /><published>2025-02-25T02:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T02:30:00+00:00</updated><id>/P</id><content type="html" xml:base="/climate-change-threaten-european-seahorses-conservation/"><![CDATA[<h5>The knowledge gap</h5>

<p>Climate change models often predict a simple poleward shift for marine life, assuming species can freely reach new suitable areas. For species with naturally low mobility, such as seahorses, this assumption is deeply flawed. We needed to understand how oceanographic connectivity—the ability of ocean currents to carry juveniles or rafting adults—interacts with climate-driven habitat shifts across their range.</p>

<h5>The main approach</h5>

<p>To address this, we integrated two powerful computational frameworks. First, we used Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (ESDM) under high- and low-emission scenarios (SSP5 and SSP2) to map where suitable seahorse habitat will be in 2100. Second, we coupled this with a state-of-the-art biophysical model to simulate two realistic dispersal pathways: short pelagic drifting (14 days) and longer passive rafting (100 days).</p>

<h5>Technological challenge: how we tackle the study</h5>

<p>The core challenge was linking predictive habitat maps with real-world ocean current simulations. We utilized coastalNet, a biophysical model, to calculate multi-generational dispersal estimates. This graph-theoretical approach allowed us to see which newly-suitable northern areas could actually be reached by seahorses originating from current populations, effectively turning an ‘unlimited movement’ prediction into a ‘connectivity-constrained’ reality.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"></div>

<h5>The main finding</h5>

<p>The incorporation of dispersal ability radically changed the forecast, revealing greater conservation risk than previously estimated:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Hippocampus guttulatus is projected to experience severe habitat contraction (up to 45% loss under high-emission scenarios), rather than the predicted expansion seen in standard models.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Hippocampus hippocampus still shows limited range expansion (+8% to +12%), but this is significantly less than the 17% expansion predicted by models that ignore dispersal limits.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Both species face severe losses across the southern distribution, particularly in the Mediterranean and North Africa, where the worst-case scenario (SSP5) projected over 80% and 50% loss for H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus, respectively.</p>

<h5>Main implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</h5>

<p>This research provides essential, grounded data for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 14 (Life Below Water). The findings necessitate an immediate shift in conservation strategy:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Prioritize climate refugia: We must strengthen protection measures in areas projected to remain stable, such as the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, and parts of the northern Iberian Atlantic Coast, especially under the lower-emission SSP2 scenario.<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Mitigate local stressors: For isolated, vulnerable populations (e.g., in the Mediterranean’s Thau Lagoon), addressing localized threats like pollution, dredging, and destructive fishing is paramount, as they cannot relocate to escape climate change.<br />

Our new research uses artificial intelligence to look back 20,000 years, revealing that the genetic strength of today’s kelp and seaweed is a direct inheritance from the Ice Age. This finding fundamentally changes how we must approach global marine conservation.</p>

<h5>Knowledge gap</h5>
<p>While we know that intraspecific genetic diversity is crucial for species survival and adaptation, global estimates for this diversity remain limited, especially for low-dispersive marine species like the brown macroalgae that form these expansive marine forests. Existing studies are fragmented, leaving a significant gap in our biogeographic understanding of their long-term evolutionary dynamics.</p>

<h5>Main approach</h5>
<p>To close this gap, we developed a unified machine learning model grounded in the niche centroid hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that genetic diversity peaks where environmental conditions are optimal (the niche centroid) and declines towards the periphery. Critically, our model integrated environmental conditions from two time periods: contemporary times (present day) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 20,000 years ago.</p>

<h5>Technological challenge - how we tackle the study</h5>
<p>The main challenge was building a predictive model robust enough to reconcile historical, present, and species-specific data. We tackled this by employing Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), a powerful machine-learning algorithm. This model was trained on genetic data from 29 brown macroalgae species and then applied to the distribution range maps of 280 marine forest species globally. This allowed us to predict and map genetic diversity across all oceans for the first time.</p>

<h5>Main finding</h5>
<p>Our models show that past climate conditions (LGM) have more than double the impact on observed genetic diversity levels than contemporary conditions. Genetic diversity is highest in regions that served as climatic refugia—areas where optimal conditions persisted even during the Ice Age. These hotspots of high genetic diversity align strongly with areas of high species richness.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Past climate conditions emerged as the key driver, explaining significantly more genetic variability than contemporary conditions.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Genetic diversity peaks at the niche centroid distance when conditions were optimal during the LGM, confirming long-term persistence is a diversity driver.
<br />
<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Global hotspots of genetic diversity were mapped, notably in the north-eastern Pacific, north-eastern Atlantic, and the south coast of Australia.</p>

<h5>Main implications</h5>
<p>This baseline information is timely and critical for meeting the goals of the UN 2030 Agenda and the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The high-resolution maps of genetic diversity hotspots can be used to:</p>
